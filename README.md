# ReputaLend - DeFi Overcollateralized Lending Protocol

## Overview

ReputaLend is a decentralized finance (DeFi) lending protocol that revolutionizes borrowing by integrating on-chain social profiles as collateral. Built during the ETH Global Istanbul 2023 Hackathon, ReputaLend utilizes smart analytics and an advanced social graph system to generate reputation scores for users, determining their eligibility to borrow assets.

## Key Features

- **Social Collateral:** Leverage on-chain social profiles (Lens, ENS, etc.) to secure loans.
- **Reputation Scoring:** Smart analytics monitor blockchain activity, assigning users a reputation score.
- **Secure Borrowing:** Users with higher reputation scores can borrow assets, fostering trust in the lending ecosystem.
- **Supported Networks:** ReputaLend leverages the capabilities of Aave, Spark, Arbitrum, Gnosis Chain, and more.

## How It Works

1. **Connect Social Profiles:** Link on-chain social profiles to establish your unique reputation.
2. **Analytics and Reputation:** Our smart analytics constantly monitor your blockchain activity, generating a reputation score.
3. **Borrow with Confidence:** Higher reputation scores unlock borrowing privileges, creating a secure and trust-driven lending environment.
